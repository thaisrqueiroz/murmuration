# Test workflow - Runs automated tests on pull requests
# This workflow ensures code quality by running tests before merging to main
name: Test

# Trigger: Run on pull requests targeting the main branch
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test-docker:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner for consistent test environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code including PR changes
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Docker Buildx for Docker operations
      # Required for building and running Docker containers
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      # Step 3: Execute the test suite using docker-compose
      # Runs tests in isolated container environment matching production
      - name: Run tests with docker-compose
        run: docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up --quiet-pull --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from test
        # --quiet-pull: Reduce output noise during image pulls
        # --abort-on-container-exit: Stop all containers when any container exits
        # --exit-code-from: Use exit code from specified container (dreamroute-test)

      # Step 4: Clean up Docker resources
      # Always runs regardless of test results to prevent resource leaks
      - name: Clean up
        if: always()  # Run even if previous steps fail
        run: docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml down -v
        # down: Stop and remove containers
        # -v: Remove associated volumes
